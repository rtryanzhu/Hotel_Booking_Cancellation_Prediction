# Abstract
In this project we use Logistic Regression, SVM, k-NN, Neural Network, Decision Tree and Random Forest models to predict the possibility of the cancellation of a hotel reservation. The best model is Neural Network with 94.71% accuracy and it is followed by k-NN (94.18%), SVM (87.94%), Random Forest (85.69%) and Logistic Regression (67.89%).
